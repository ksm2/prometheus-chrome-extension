# Privacy Policy
Your data always belongs to you, and only you.
The Prometheus Chrome Extension does not collect any data.

## How your data is protected and used
- By default, the Prometheus Chrome Extension does not send any data to his servers or any third parties. All your data is processed and stored locally on your device. 
- When processing a page, the extension needs to inject temporary data into the page to save it accurately. When using the Prometheus Chrome Extension in Chromium-based browsers, websites can fetch resources declared in the "web_accessible_resources" section of the manifest.json file. Because of this, a website may be able to detect you are using Prometheus Chrome Extension or have saved a page on the website with Prometheus Chrome Extension.

## Customer support
When you request for customer support, we may ask for your email address to get back to you.
